Q1. What is a Computer ?
Ans. A computer is a programmable electronic device that processes data and performs various tasks according to a set of instructions called a program. It can store, retrieve, and process data, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of applications. Computers come in various forms and sizes, from personal computers (PCs) and laptops to servers, mainframes, and supercomputers.

Q2. What is RAM?
Ans. RAM, or Random Access Memory, is a type of computer memory that is used to store data and machine code currently being used and processed by a computer. Unlike storage devices such as hard drives or SSDs, which retain data even when the power is turned off, RAM is volatile memory, meaning it loses its contents when the power is turned off.

Q3. Where is data stored in a computer?
Ans.  Data in a computer is stored in various locations depending on the nature and purpose of the data. The two primary types of storage in a computer are:

RAM (Random Access Memory): RAM is volatile memory, and it is used to store data that is actively being used or processed by the computer. It is a form of temporary storage, and its contents are erased when the computer is powered off. RAM allows the CPU to quickly access and manipulate data during the execution of programs.

Storage Devices (Hard Drives, SSDs, etc.): Data that needs to be stored for the long term, even when the power is turned off, is saved on non-volatile storage devices. These include hard disk drives (HDDs), solid-state drives (SSDs), and other types of storage media. This is where the operating system, applications, documents, multimedia files, and other user data are typically stored.

Q4. What is that input device used to type text and numbers on a document in the computer system?
Ans. 
The input device used to type text and numbers on a document in a computer system is called a "keyboard." A keyboard is a peripheral device that typically consists of a set of keys or buttons, each representing a specific character, letter, number, or function. Users can press these keys to input text, numbers, and various commands into the computer.

Q5. What are the output devices?
Ans. Output devices are peripherals that provide information from a computer to the user or to other systems. They display or present processed data in a human-readable form. Here are some common output devices:

1.Monitor (or Display): A monitor is the most common output device for displaying visual information. It shows text, graphics, videos, and other visual content generated by the computer. Monitors come in various types, including CRT (Cathode Ray Tube) monitors (less common today), LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) monitors, LED (Light Emitting Diode) monitors, and more.

2.Printer: Printers produce hard copies of documents or images. There are different types of printers, such as inkjet printers, laser printers, and dot matrix printers, each with its own advantages and use cases.

3.Speakers: Speakers are output devices that produce audio sounds and allow users to hear music, voice, or other audio content generated by the computer.

4.Headphones: Similar to speakers, headphones provide audio output for the user. They are worn on the ears and can be used for private listening.

5.Projector: A projector is used to display computer-generated images or presentations on a large screen or surface. It is commonly used in conference rooms, classrooms, and home theaters.

6.Plotter: Plotters are specialized output devices used for producing high-quality graphics, such as detailed engineering drawings or maps. They use pens or other writing tools to create precise lines on paper.

7.Touchscreen: A touchscreen is a display that can detect the presence and location of a touch within its area. It allows users to interact with the computer by touching the screen directly, making it both an input and output device.

8.Haptic Feedback Devices: Some devices provide haptic feedback, which is tactile feedback in the form of vibrations or movements. Examples include force-feedback joysticks or controllers that vibrate during gaming.

Q6. Which is the input device that allows a user to move the cursor or pointer on the screen?
Ans. Mouse

Q7. Which language is directly understood by the computer without a translation program?
Ans. Machine Language

Q8. What are input devices?
Ans. Input devices are tools that allow users to input data, commands, or information into a computer or other electronic device. These devices facilitate communication between the user and the computer system. Here are some common input devices:

1.Keyboard: A keyboard is a set of keys that typically represent letters, numbers, symbols, and functions. Users press keys to input text and commands into the computer.

2.Mouse: A mouse is a pointing device with buttons and a scrolling wheel. It is used to move a cursor on the screen, select items, and interact with graphical user interfaces.

3.Touchpad: Common on laptops, a touchpad is a touch-sensitive surface that serves as a pointing device. Users can move the cursor by sliding their finger across the touchpad.

4.Touchscreen: Touchscreens allow users to interact with a computer by directly touching the display. They are commonly found in tablets, smartphones, and some laptops.

5.Graphics Tablet: Graphics tablets, or digitizers, are used by artists and designers to draw or input graphics directly into the computer using a stylus or pen on a sensitive surface.

6.Scanner: A scanner converts physical documents or images into digital format. It captures a digital image of the content, which can then be stored or manipulated on a computer.

7.Microphone: A microphone captures audio input, allowing users to record sound or provide voice commands to the computer. It is commonly used for voice recognition and communication applications.

8.Webcam: A webcam captures video input, enabling users to participate in video calls, conferences, or record videos.

9.Barcode Reader: Barcode readers use laser or camera technology to read barcodes on products, documents, or identification cards, providing a quick and accurate way to input information.

10.Joystick and Gamepad: Joysticks and gamepads are input devices designed for gaming. They allow users to control characters or interact with virtual environments in video games.

11.Biometric Input Devices: Biometric devices, such as fingerprint scanners or facial recognition cameras, use unique physical characteristics to authenticate and grant access to the computer or certain applications.
